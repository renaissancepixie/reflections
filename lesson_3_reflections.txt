When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?

  When collaborating with others across locations or when doing work by yourself from several different locations.  Or to have an extra backup.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to control the timing to ensure data does not become corrupted (in case of weak signal or dying battery), and you just may not need to download absolutely everything--maybe there's a branch you're not working on at all.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks:  when you're playing with someone else's stuff
    Clones: when you're copying a remote file 
    Branches: when you're branching off within the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
